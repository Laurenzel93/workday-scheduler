I needed to use the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time.

## User Story

AS AN employee with a busy schedule <br>
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner <br>
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively <br>

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule<br>
WHEN I open the planner<br>
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar<br>
WHEN I scroll down<br>
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours<br>
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day<br>
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future<br>
WHEN I click into a timeblock<br>
THEN I can enter an event<br>
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock<br>
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage<br>
WHEN I refresh the page<br>
THEN the saved events persist<br>
```
